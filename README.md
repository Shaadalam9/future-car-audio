# Future Car Audio Project

## Introduction
The Future Car Audio project is an innovative Python application designed to simulate futuristic car audio effects based on various sensor inputs. It utilizes real-time data to adjust audio feedback, creating an immersive driving experience.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up your copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shaadalam9/future-car-audio.git
   cd future-car-audio
   ```

2. **Set up a Python virtual environment (Optional but recommended)**

   - Creating a virtual environment:

     On Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```

     On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```

   - Activating the virtual environment:

     On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

     On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

After setting up the project environment and installing the required dependencies, you can run the main application script:

```bash
python drive.py
```

## Features

- Real-time audio feedback adjustment based on sensor data simulation.
- Immersive sound effects that enhance the user experience in simulated car driving scenarios.
